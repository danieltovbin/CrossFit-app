# CrossFit Website
I am a fan of coding and CrossFit, so I decided to create a CrossFit website. I took inspiration from a few different random CrossFit sites and made my own website.

## Features
- **Homepage**: Learn about what CrossFit is and what it can do for you.
- **Demo Video**: A short video demonstrating CrossFit.
- **Contact Us**: At the bottom of the homepage, you can send a message.
- **Navigation**: The header includes navigation links. Both "GETTING STARTED" and "CONTACT US" are on the homepage, while "Shop" is on a separate page.
- **404 Page**: Displayed when trying to access a non-existent page.

## Tools and Technologies
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for the web.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **SCSS**: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets for enhanced styling.
- **BEM**: Block Element Modifier methodology for naming CSS classes.
- **Context**: React Context API for managing state.

## How to Use
navigate to the main branch and clone the repository: https://github.com/danieltovbin/CrossFit-app.git 

Open the terminal and set up the client:
cd client
npm install
npm run dev

Set up the server:

## Enjoy exploring the CrossFit website!
